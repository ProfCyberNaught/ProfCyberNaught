Greetings!

It's great to connect with you all. I'm a versatile professional who's constantly honing my skills to become a master in my crafts. My passion for education led me to teach mathematics at university, while my love for music inspired me to become the founder of a professional studio, assisting aspiring musicians to showcase their talents, develop their talents by teaching them advanced skills, and professionally grading their achievements.

In addition to that, I also founded my own IT consultancy business, offering comprehensive tech solutions, privacy audits, and strategic planning services to companies. With multiple degrees in Psychology, Law, Sociology, Education, and Management, as well as completion of a cybersecurity bootcamp studying industry principles, along with studying Lean Organisational Management, and User IT Skills, I possess a wide array of qualifications and expertise (trying to prevent you from falling asleep by not listing all my education here).

As a tech enthusiast, I enjoy getting involved in coding, with PHP being my favorite language, and staying updated with the latest developments in cybersecurity and privacy. My love for coding started at a young age, when I began programming on an Amstrad 464 with a green CRT monitor at the tender age of 8.

When I'm not working, you can find me (if you can keep up) on a nature trail, taking a long walk or immersed in a good book. My reading interests include privacy, security, positive psychology, and fictional recreations of Roman battles, among others. I'm always eager to explore new things and challenge myself intellectually.

I'm excited to connect with all of you and eager to share my insights and experiences. By the way, I've also started a blog that might pique your interest. Let's stay connected and make great things happen!
