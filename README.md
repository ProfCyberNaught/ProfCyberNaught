## Who is ProfCyberNaught?

I'm a versatile professional who's constantly honing my skills to become a master in my crafts. My passion for education led me to teach mathematics at university, while my love for music inspired me to become the founder of a professional music studio, assisting aspiring musicians to showcase their talents, develop their knowledge by teaching them advanced theory skills, and professionally grading their achievements on multiple instruments.

In addition to that, I also founded my own IT consultancy business, offering comprehensive tech solutions, privacy audits, and strategic planning services to companies.

## Education Credentials

Sorry to disappoint, but I won't be putting you to sleep with a long list of degrees and certifications. Trust me, you don't want to know about my expertise in llama grooming or my advanced training in cat juggling. So, let's just skip the yawn-inducing parts and get to the juicy stuff, shall we? I hold _multiple_ degrees covering Psychology, Law, Sociology, Education, and Management, as well as studying **Cybersecurity Industry Principles**.

## Privacy Advocate

Privacy, privacy, privacy - this is my grief! As someone who values personal freedom and autonomy, I'm a firm believer in safeguarding our privacy rights. After all, who wants their every move tracked and recorded like a lab rat? Not me, that's for sure! Let's keep those prying eyes out of our business and our personal data under lock and key, where it belongs.

Ah, the sweet sound of **encryption** - it's like music to my ears! As a staunch **supporter of privacy and security**, I firmly believe in everyone's right to encryption. Who wants their personal information and data floating around in cyberspace like a hot potato? Let's keep our digital lives on lockdown and make sure that no one can snoop around where they don't belong (let's stick it to '**Surveillance Capitalism**').

I'm a huge fan of the **fediverse** - it's like social media, but with a conscience! As someone who **values privacy and community**, I'm a firm believer in the **decentralised** and **open-source** approach. It's refreshing to have a platform where we can connect with others without sacrificing our personal information or being bombarded by targeted ads. Let's keep building this **digital oasis** and say no to the big boys!

## Enthusiastic Interests

As a **tech enthusiast**, I enjoy getting involved in coding, with **PHP** being my favorite language, and staying updated with the latest developments in **cybersecurity** and **privacy**. My love for coding started at a young age, when I began programming on an Amstrad 464 with my green-colour-screen CRT monitor at the tender age of 8.

When I'm not working, you can find me (if you can keep up) on a nature trail, taking a long walk or immersed in a good book. My reading interests include privacy, security, psychology, self help, and limited fictional recreations, among others.

Ugh, **advertisements make me want to pull my hair out!** That's why I avoid regular TV like the plague, and block adverts using **pfSense firewall** on my network. But, there are a few boxsets I own that are worth the occasional watch - Friends, Voyager, and Two and a Half Men have all found a special place in my heart. I mean, who can resist the wacky antics of Ross and Rachel, the bold explorations of the USS Voyager, or the hilarious hijinks of Charlie and Alan?

I'm always eager to explore new things and challenge myself intellectually.

## Connecting with People

I'm excited to connect with all of you and eager to share my insights and experiences. By the way, I've also started a blog that might pique your interest. Let's stay connected and make great things happen!
